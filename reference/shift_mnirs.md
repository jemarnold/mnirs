# Shift data range

Move the range of data channels in a data frame up or down, while
preserving the absolute amplitude/dynamic range of each channel, and the
relative scaling across channels. e.g. shift the minimum data value to
zero for all positive values, or shift the mean of the first time span
in a recording to zero.

## Usage

``` r
shift_mnirs(
  data,
  nirs_channels = NULL,
  time_channel = NULL,
  group_channels = c("ensemble", "distinct"),
  to = NULL,
  by = NULL,
  width = NULL,
  span = NULL,
  position = c("min", "max", "first"),
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A data frame of class *"mnirs"* containing time series data and
  metadata, a list of data frames, or a grouped data frame (see
  *Details*).

- nirs_channels:

  A character vector giving the names of mNIRS columns to operate on.
  Must match column names in `data` exactly.

  - If `NULL` (default), the `nirs_channels` metadata attribute of
    `data` is used.

- time_channel:

  A character string naming the time or sample column. Must match a
  column name in `data` exactly.

  - If `NULL` (default), the `time_channel` metadata attribute of `data`
    is used.

- group_channels:

  Either a character string or a
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html) of channel-name vectors
  specifying how to group `nirs_channels` (see *Details*).

  `"ensemble"`

  :   The *default*. Operate on all channels together, preserving the
      relative scaling between channels.

  `"distinct"`

  :   Operate on each channel independently, losing the relative scaling
      between channels.

  `list(c("A", "B"), c("C", "D"))`

  :   Operate on channels `A` & `B` in one group, and `C` & `D` in
      another group. Groups can be named (e.g.
      `list(smo2 = c("A", "B"))`). Each group must be non-empty and
      resulting group names must be unique.

- to:

  A numeric value in units of `nirs_channels` to which the data channels
  will be shifted, e.g. shift the minimum value to zero.

- by:

  A numeric value in units of `nirs_channels` by which the data channels
  will be shifted, e.g. shift all values up by 10 units.

- width:

  An integer defining the local window in number of samples centred on
  `idx`, between `[idx - floor(width/2), idx + floor(width/2)]`.

- span:

  A numeric value defining the local window time span around `idx` in
  units of `time_channel` or `t`, between `[t - span/2, t + span/2]`.

- position:

  Indicates where the reference values will be shifted from.

  `"min"`

  :   (The *default*) will shift the minimum value(s) `to` or `by` the
      specified value.

  `"max"`

  :   Will shift the maximum value(s) `to` or `by` the specified values.

  `"first"`

  :   Will shift first value(s) `to` or `by` the specified values.

- verbose:

  Logical. `TRUE` (*default*) will display, and `FALSE` will silence
  warnings and information messages helpful for troubleshooting. Global
  default can be set via `options(mnirs.verbose = FALSE)`.

## Value

A [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/reference/tibble-package.html)
of class *"mnirs"* with metadata available with
[`attributes()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/attributes.html). For list or
grouped data frame input, returns a named list of *"mnirs"* tibbles, one
per interval.

## Details

`group_channels` controls how data channels are grouped to preserve
absolute or relative scaling (see
[`rescale_mnirs()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/rescale_mnirs.md)).

- `group_channels = "ensemble"` (the *default*) shifts all
  `nirs_channels` to a common value, preserving relative scaling between
  channels.

- `group_channels = "distinct"` shifts each channel independently,
  losing relative scaling between channels.

- A [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html) of channel-name vectors
  (e.g. `list(c("A", "B"), c("C", "D"))`) shifts channels `A` & `B`
  together and `C` & `D` together, preserving relative scaling within,
  but not between groups. `nirs_channels` omitted from the list are
  rescaled independently.

- Channel groups can be named (e.g. `list(smo2 = c("A", "B"))`) and
  names used as keys for per-group arguments.

Only one of either `to` or `by` and one of either `width` or `span`
should be defined for each `group_channels`. If both of either pairing
are defined, `to` will be preferred over `by`, and `width` will be
preferred over `span`.

- Channels (columns) in `data` not in `nirs_channels` are passed through
  without processing to the output data frame.

`nirs_channels` and `time_channel` can be retrieved automatically from
`data` of class *"mnirs"* which has been processed with `{mnirs}`, if
not defined explicitly.

When `position` is *"min"* or *"max"*, only full windows of `width` or
`span` are considered, to avoid bias from noise at edge conditions with
partial samples.

## Per-channel arguments

Arguments apply globally to all `nirs_channels` by default. Relevant
arguments can instead be supplied uniquely per-channel as a named
[`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html), with names matching either
`nirs_channels` or list names in `group_channels`, e.g.

    shift_mnirs(
        data,
        nirs_channels = c(A, B, C),
        group_channels = list(smo2 = c(A, B), hhb = C),
        to = list(100, C = 0),
        width = list(smo2 = 3),
        span = list(hhb = 5),
        position = "first"
    )

- A non-list value applies to every channel (the *default* behaviour).

- A [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html) named by
  `nirs_channels` or `group_channels` applies per-channel / per-group
  values.

- A single unnamed value in the list will be applied to unlisted
  channels (e.g. `span = list(3, hhb = 5)` gives `hhb` 5 and every other
  channel 3). If no unnamed fallback value in the list, channels not
  named in the list will be returned un-processed (e.g.
  `span = list(hhb = 5)` will only process `hhb`).

- [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html) names not matching
  `nirs_channels` or `group_channels` are warned about and ignored.

## Data input formats

*mnirs* processing functions accept `data` in multiple formats:

- A **single *"mnirs"* data frame** is processed and returned directly.

- A **list of *"mnirs"* data frames**: each interval is processed
  separately and returned as a named list.

- A **grouped *"mnirs"* data frame**, e.g. with
  [`dplyr::group_by()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html):
  the data frame is split by grouping levels and each group is processed
  as a separate interval, returned as a named list.

## Examples

``` r
## read example data
data <- read_mnirs(
    file_path = example_mnirs("moxy_ramp"),
    nirs_channels = c(smo2_left = "SmO2 Live",
                      smo2_right = "SmO2 Live(2)"),
    time_channel = c(time = "hh:mm:ss"),
    verbose = FALSE
) |>
    shift_mnirs(        ## un-grouped nirs channels to shift separately
        nirs_channels = c(smo2_left, smo2_right),
        group_channels = "distinct",
        to = 0,         ## NIRS values will be shifted to zero
        span = 120,     ## shift the *first* 120 sec of data to zero
        position = "first"
    )
