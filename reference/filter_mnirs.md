# Filter a data frame

Apply digital filtering/smoothing to numeric vector data within a data
frame using either:

1.  A cubic smoothing spline.

2.  A Butterworth digital filter.

3.  A simple moving average.

Note the `method`-specific arguments below.

## Usage

``` r
filter_mnirs(
  data,
  nirs_channels = NULL,
  time_channel = NULL,
  method = c("smooth_spline", "butterworth", "moving_average"),
  na.rm = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...,
  spar = NULL,
  order = 2L,
  W = NULL,
  fc = NULL,
  sample_rate = NULL,
  type = c("low", "high", "stop", "pass"),
  edges = c("rev", "rep1", "none"),
  width = NULL,
  span = NULL,
  partial = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A data frame of class *"mnirs"* containing time series data and
  metadata, a list of data frames, or a grouped data frame (see
  *Details*).

- nirs_channels:

  A character vector giving the names of mNIRS columns to operate on.
  Must match column names in `data` exactly.

  - If `NULL` (default), the `nirs_channels` metadata attribute of
    `data` is used.

- time_channel:

  A character string naming the time or sample column. Must match a
  column name in `data` exactly.

  - If `NULL` (default), the `time_channel` metadata attribute of `data`
    is used.

- method:

  A character string indicating how to filter the data. Additional
  arguments must be specified for each method. See *Details*.

  `"smooth_spline"`

  :   Fits a cubic smoothing spline. Additional arguments: `spar`.

  `"butterworth"`

  :   Uses a centred Butterworth digital filter. Additional arguments:
      `order`, `W` or `fc`, `sample_rate`, `type`, `edges`. See
      [`filter_butterworth()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/filter_butterworth.md).

  `"moving_average"`

  :   Uses a centred moving average filter. Additional arguments:
      `width` or `span`, `partial`. See
      [`filter_moving_average()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/filter_moving_average.md).

- na.rm:

  Logical; default is `FALSE`, propagates any `NA`s to the returned
  vector. If `TRUE`, ignores `NA`s and processes available valid samples
  within the local window. May return errors or warnings. (see
  *Details*).

- verbose:

  Logical. `TRUE` (*default*) will display, and `FALSE` will silence
  warnings and information messages helpful for troubleshooting. Global
  default can be set via `options(mnirs.verbose = FALSE)`.

- ...:

  Additional arguments passed to the underlying method function. See
  *Details*.

- spar:

  **smooth_spline**: A numeric smoothing parameter passed to
  [`stats::smooth.spline()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/smooth.spline.html).
  If `NULL` (*default*), automatically determined via penalised log
  likelihood.

- order:

  **butterworth**: An integer defining the filter order (*default*
  `order = 2`).

- W:

  **butterworth**: A one- or two-element numeric vector within `[0, 1]`
  defining the filter cutoff frequency(ies) as a fraction of the Nyquist
  frequency (see *Details*). One of either `W` or `fc` must be
  specified.

- fc:

  **butterworth**: A one- or two-element numeric vector defining the
  filter absolute cutoff frequency in Hz. Used with `sample_rate` to
  compute `W`. One of either `W` or `fc` must be specified.

- sample_rate:

  **butterworth**: A numeric sample rate in Hz. Will be taken from
  metadata or estimated from `time_channel` if not defined.

- type:

  **butterworth**: A character string specifying filter type, one of:
  `c("low", "high", "stop", "pass")` (`"low"` is the *default*).

- edges:

  **butterworth**: A character string specifying the edge padding, one
  of: `c("rev", "rep1", "none")` (`"rev"` is the *default*). See
  [`filter_butterworth()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/filter_butterworth.md).

- width:

  **moving_average**: An integer number of samples within the local
  window. One of either `width` or `span` must be specified.

- span:

  **moving_average**: A numeric time duration in units of `time_channel`
  within the local window. One of either `width` or `span` must be
  specified.

- partial:

  **moving_average**: Logical; default is `FALSE`, only returns values
  where a full window of valid (non-`NA`) samples are available. If
  `TRUE`, ignores `NA` and processes available valid samples (see
  *Details*).

## Value

A [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/reference/tibble-package.html)
of class *"mnirs"* with metadata available with
[`attributes()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/attributes.html). For list or
grouped data frame input, returns a named list of *"mnirs"* tibbles, one
per interval.

## Details

### method = "smooth_spline"

Aliases: `method = c("smooth spline", "spline")`

Applies a non-parametric cubic smoothing spline from
[`stats::smooth.spline()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/smooth.spline.html).
Smoothing is defined by the parameter `spar`, which can be left as
`NULL` and automatically determined via penalised log likelihood. This
usually works well for responses occurring on the order of minutes or
longer. `spar` can be specified typically, but not necessarily, in the
range `spar = [0, 1]`.

### method = "butterworth"

Aliases: `method = c("butter")`

Applies a centred (two-pass symmetrical) Butterworth digital filter from
[`signal::butter()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/signal/man/butter.html) and
[`signal::filtfilt()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/signal/man/filtfilt.html).

Filter `type` defines how the desired signal frequencies are either
passed or rejected from the output signal. *Low-pass* and *high-pass*
filters allow only frequencies *lower* or *higher* than the cutoff
frequency, respectively to be passed through to the output signal.
*Stop-band* defines a critical range of frequencies which are rejected
from the output signal. *Pass-band* defines a critical range of
frequencies which are passed through as the output signal.

The filter order (number of passes) is defined by `order`, typically in
the range `order = [1, 10]`. Higher filter order tends to capture more
rapid changes in amplitude, but also causes more distortion around those
change points in the signal. General advice is to use the lowest filter
order which sufficiently captures the desired rapid responses in the
data.

The critical (cutoff) frequency can be defined by `W`, a numeric value
for *low-pass* and *high-pass* filters, or a two-element vector
`c(low, high)` defining the lower and upper bands for *stop-band* and
*pass-band* filters. `W` represents the desired fractional cutoff
frequency in the range `W = [0, 1]`, where `1` is the Nyquist frequency,
i.e., half the `sample_rate` of the data in Hz.

Alternatively, the cutoff frequency can be defined by `fc` and
`sample_rate` together. `fc` represents the desired cutoff frequency
directly in Hz, and `sample_rate` is the sample rate of the recorded
data in Hz. Where `W = fc / (sample_rate / 2)`.

Only one of either `W` or `fc` should be defined. If both are defined,
`W` will be preferred over `fc`.

### method = "moving_average"

Aliases: `method = c("moving average", "ma")`

Applies a centred (symmetrical) moving average filter in a local window,
defined by either `width` as the number of samples around `idx` between
`[idx - floor(width/2), idx + floor(width/2)]`. Or by `span` as the
timespan in units of `time_channel` between `[t - span/2, t + span/2]`.

### Missing values

Missing values (`NA`) in `nirs_channels` will cause an error for
`method = "smooth_spline"` or `"butterworth"`, unless `na.rm = TRUE`.
Then `NA`s will be ignored and passed through to the returned data.

For `method = "moving_average"`, `na.rm` controls whether `NA`s within
each local window are either propagated to the returned vector when
`na.rm = FALSE` (the default), or ignored before processing if
`na.rm = TRUE`.

## Data input formats

*mnirs* processing functions accept `data` in multiple formats:

- A **single *"mnirs"* data frame** is processed and returned directly.

- A **list of *"mnirs"* data frames**: each interval is processed
  separately and returned as a named list.

- A **grouped *"mnirs"* data frame**, e.g. with
  [`dplyr::group_by()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html):
  the data frame is split by grouping levels and each group is processed
  as a separate interval, returned as a named list.

## Per-channel arguments

Arguments apply globally to all `nirs_channels` by default. Relevant
arguments can instead be supplied uniquely per-channel as a named
[`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html), with names matching
`nirs_channels`, e.g.

    replace_mnirs(
        data,
        nirs_channels = c(hhb, smo2),
        invalid_values = list(hhb = -1, smo2 = c(0, 100)),
        invalid_above = list(hhb = 10),
        span = list(3, hhb = 5)
    )

- A non-list value applies to every channel (the *default* behaviour).

- A [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html) named by
  `nirs_channels` applies per-channel values.

- A single unnamed value in the list will be applied to unlisted
  channels (e.g. `span = list(3, hhb = 5)` gives `hhb` 5 and every other
  channel 3). If no unnamed fallback value in the list, channels not
  named in the list will be returned un-processed (e.g.
  `span = list(hhb = 5)` will only process `hhb`).

- [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html) names not matching
  `nirs_channels` are warned about and ignored.
