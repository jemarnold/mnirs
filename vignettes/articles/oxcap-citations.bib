   abstract = {Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) provides a simple and reliable measure of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity; however, its relationship to aerobic fitness and sex are unclear. We hypothesized that NIRS-derived oxidative capacity in the vastus lateralis (VL) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) would be correlated with indices of aerobic fitness and independent of sex. Twenty-six participants (13 males, 13 females) performed ramp- and step-incremental tests to volitional exhaustion on separate days to establish maximal oxygen uptake (V̇o2max), peak power output (PPO), lactate threshold (LT), gas exchange threshold (GET), respiratory compensation point (RCP), and maximal fat oxidation (MFO). Data were normalized to lean body mass to account for sex-based differences in body composition. Exercise tests were preceded by duplicate measurements of NIRS-derived oxidative capacity on the VL and MG muscles (i.e., repeated arterial occlusions following a brief set of muscle contractions). Skeletal muscle oxidative capacity for the VL (means ± SD: 21.9 ± 4.6 s) and MG (22.5 ± 6.1 s) were similar but unrelated (r2 = 0.03, P = 0.39). Skeletal muscle oxidative capacity for the VL, but not the MG (P > 0.05 for all variables), was significantly correlated with V̇o2max (r2 = 0.24; P = 0.01), PPO (r2 = 0.23; P = 0.01), LT (r2 = 0.23; P = 0.01), GET (r2 = 0.23; P = 0.01), and RCP (r2 = 0.27; P = 0.006). MFO was not correlated with VL or MG skeletal muscle oxidative capacity (P > 0.05). Females (54.9 ± 4.5 mL·kg LBM−1·min−1) and males (56.0 ± 6.2 mL·kg LBM−1·min−1), matched for V̇o2max (P = 0.62), had similar NIRS-derived oxidative capacities for VL (20.7 ± 4.4 vs. 23.2 ± 4.6 s; P = 0.18) and MG (24.4 ± 6.8 vs. 20.5 ± 4.8 s; P = 0.10). Overall, NIRS-derived skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in VL is indicative of aerobic fitness and independent of sex in humans.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can be used to measure skeletal muscle oxidative capacity. Here, we demonstrated that NIRS-derived skeletal muscle oxidative capacity of the vastus lateralis was independent of sex, reliable across and within days, and correlated with maximal and submaximal indices of aerobic fitness, including maximal oxygen uptake, lactate threshold, and respiratory compensation point. These findings highlight the utility of NIRS for investigating skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in females and males.},

   abstract = {Assessment of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-derived muscle oxidative capacity relies on analysing deoxygenation slopes from NIRS signal versus time curves during brief arterial occlusions, which reflect the rate of post-exercise recovery of muscle oxygen consumption ( V̇O2m ). However, current guidelines lack recommendations on the optimal selection of slopes for reliable measurement. The aim of the study was to compare a standardised partial-segment approach against the conventional whole-segment approach on the measurement and reliability of in vivo muscle oxidative capacity. Within the same session, 19 athletes (n = 9 sprinters; n = 10 middle-distance runners) completed two NIRS-derived muscle oxidative capacity trials on the vastus lateralis. Rate constants (k, min(-1)) were computed using the steepest ( khigh.S ), whole ( kwhole.S ) or shallowest ( klow.S ) deoxygenation slope from deoxyhaemoglobin (HHb) and muscle O(2) saturation ( SmO2 ) signals. Test-retest reliability [(coefficient of variation (CV), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)] and minimum difference (MD) were assessed. For the HHb signal, ICC analysis revealed moderate to excellent test-retest reliability for khigh.S [0.80 (0.54-0.92)], whereas poor to good reliability was observed for kwhole.S [0.71 (0.38-0.89)] and klow.S [0.60 (0.19-0.83)]. khigh.S led to lower MD compared to kwhole.S and klow.S (0.64 vs. 1.12 vs. 1.54 min(-1), respectively). All three approaches led to significantly greater k values in runners compared to sprinters ( khigh.S :+32.2%, P < 0.001; kwhole.S :+ 40.1%, P = 0.025; klow.S :+49.6%, P = 0.001). Compared to the conventional whole-segment approach, selecting the steepest intra-occlusion slope improved the reliability and sensitivity of NIRS-derived mitochondrial capacity, likely by better reflecting instantaneous changes in V̇O2m .},

   abstract = {Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a well-known method used to measure muscle oxygenation and hemodynamics in vivo. The application of arterial occlusions allows for the assessment of muscle oxygen consumption (mVo(2)) using NIRS. The aim of this study was to measure skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacity using blood volume-corrected NIRS signals that represent oxygenated hemoglobin/myoglobin (O(2)Hb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin/myoglobin (HHb). We also assessed the reliability and reproducibility of NIRS measurements of resting oxygen consumption and mitochondrial capacity. Twenty-four subjects, including four with chronic spinal cord injury, were tested using either the vastus lateralis or gastrocnemius muscles. Ten healthy, able-bodied subjects were tested on two occasions within a period of 7 days to assess the reliability and reproducibility. NIRS signals were corrected for blood volume changes using three different methods. Resting oxygen consumption had a mean coefficient of variation (CV) of 2.4% (range 1-32%). The recovery of oxygen consumption (mVo(2)) after electrical stimulation at 4 Hz was fit to an exponential curve, which represents mitochondrial capacity. The time constant for the recovery of mVo(2) was reproducible with a mean CV of 10% (range 1-22%) only when correcting for blood volume changes. We also examined the effects of adipose tissue thickness on measurements of mVo(2). We found the mVo(2) measurements using absolute units to be influenced by adipose tissue thickness (ATT), and this relationship was removed when an ischemic calibration was performed, supporting its use to compare mVo(2) between individuals of varying ATT. In conclusion, in vivo oxidative capacity can be assessed using blood volume-corrected NIRS signals with a high degree of reliability and reproducibility.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this study was to cross-validate measurements of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity made with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements to those made with phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31)P-MRS). Sixteen young (age = 22.5 +/- 3.0 yr), healthy individuals were tested with both (31)P-MRS and NIRS during a single testing session. The recovery rate of phosphocreatine was measured inside the bore of a 3-Tesla MRI scanner, after short-duration ( approximately 10 s) plantar flexion exercise as an index of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity. Using NIRS, the recovery rate of muscle oxygen consumption was also measured using repeated, transient arterial occlusions outside the MRI scanner, after short-duration ( approximately 10 s) plantar flexion exercise as another index of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity. The average recovery time constant was 31.5 +/- 8.5 s for phosphocreatine and 31.5 +/- 8.9 s for muscle oxygen consumption for all participants (P = 0.709). (31)P-MRS time constants correlated well with NIRS time constants for both channel 1 (Pearson's r = 0.88, P < 0.0001) and channel 2 (Pearson's r = 0.95, P < 0.0001). Furthermore, both (31)P-MRS and NIRS exhibit good repeatability between trials (coefficient of variation = 8.1, 6.9, and 7.9% for NIRS channel 1, NIRS channel 2, and (31)P-MRS, respectively). The good agreement between NIRS and (31)P-MRS indexes of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity suggest that NIRS is a valid method for assessing mitochondrial function, and that direct comparisons between NIRS and (31)P-MRS measurements may be possible.},

Males (n=12) and females (n=12), matched for maximal aerobic fitness per fat-free mass, completed NIRS-derived skeletal muscle oxidative capacity tests for the vastus lateralis following repeated contractions at 40% (τ40) and 100% (τ100) of maximum voluntary contraction, underwent a skeletal muscle biopsy of the same muscle, and performed multiple intermittent isometric knee extension tests to task failure to establish critical torque (CT). τ100 (34.4±7.0 s) was greater than τ40 (24.2±6.9 s, p<0.001), but the values were correlated (r=0.688; p<0.001). τ40 (r=-0.692, p<0.001) and τ100 (r=-0.488, p=0.016) correlated with myosin heavy chain I percentage as well as several markers of mitochondrial content, including COX II protein content in whole muscle (τ40: r=-0.547, p=0.006; τ100: r=-0.466, p=0.022), type I pooled fibres (τ40: r=-0.547, p=0.006; τ100: r=-0.547, p=0.006), and type II pooled fibres (τ40: r=-0.516, p=0.009; τ100: r=-0.635, p=0.001). τ40 (r=-0.702, p<0.001), but not τ100 (r=-0.378, p=0.083) correlated with CT; however, neither value correlated with W' (τ40: r=0.071, p=0.753; τ100: r=0.054, p=0.812).
