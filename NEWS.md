# mnirs 0.8.0

The initial release of `analyse_kinetics()` and family of kinetics modelling functions!

## `analyse_kinetics()`

* `analyse_kinetics()` fits oxygenation response kinetics with parametric and non-parametric methods. It accepts a single *"mnirs"* data frame, a list of data frames, or a grouped data frame, analyses `nirs_channels` in each interval, and returns a formatted table of results.

* See `?analyse_kinetics` for the canonical (i.e. human-verified) documentation of all methods, arguments, and returned objects.

``` r
analyse_kinetics(
    data,
    nirs_channels = c(smo2_left, smo2_right),
    method = "monoexponential",
    use_TD = TRUE,      ## use time delay parameter
    direction = "auto"  ## auto-detect response direction
) |> 
    print() |>  ## the formatted table prints the coefficients
    plot()      ## plot observations & fitted data
```

* `method` argument selects the kinetics model. Each has its own additional arguments:

    * `"response_time"` — non-parametric fractional (e.g. 50%) response time.

    * `"peak_slope"` — peak rolling linear least-squares regression slope.

    * `"monoexponential"` — 3- or 4-parameter exponential curve fit via `stats::nls()`.

    * `"exponential_drift"` — two-phase fast monoexponential primary response plus slow linear secondary drift.

    * `"biexponential"` — two-phase fast primary and slow secondary exponential phases.

    * `"sigmoidal"` — 4-parameter symmetric generalised logistic or Gompertz-family curve.

    * `"sigmoidal_drift"` — two-phase fast sigmoidal primary response plus slow linear secondary drift.

* Most arguments can be supplied globally or per-channel and per-interval. However, `method` itself currently only accepts a single global model for all channels.

* Results are returned as a structured list of class *"mnirs_kinetics"*, containing:

    * `method`: the selected kinetics model.
    * `model`: the `lm` or `nls` objects.
    * `coefficients`: resultant model parameters.
    * `data`: the input data augmented with `*_fitted` columns per `nirs_channel`.
    * `interval_times`: `start_times` and `end_times` of the analysed intervals.
    * `diagnostics`: fit quality and model validation parameters used to evaluate and compare model fits.
    * `channel_args`: selected per-channel and per-interval args.
    * `warnings`: any warning and error messages generated during fitting.
    * `call`: the matched call.

* `print.mnirs_kinetics()` returns a formatted coefficients table, and `plot.mnirs_kinetics()` displays the observed data overlaid with fitted curves for each channel and interval.


## Vector-level and model functions

The individual fitting methods called by `analyse_kinetics()` can be called directly outside of the *"mnirs"* data structure:

* `response_time()` and `peak_slope()` estimate kinetics directly from a numeric vector `x` over `t`, and return a named list of coefficients (with the `lm` model object for `peak_slope()`).

``` r
peak_slope(x, t, width = 5, direction = "auto")

response_time(x, t, start_time = 10, response_fraction = c(0.5, 0.632))
```

* `monoexponential()`, `exponential_drift()`, `biexponential()`, `logistic()`, `gompertz()`, `gompertz_left()`, and `sigmoidal_drift()` contain the parametric equations for each model response curves. They can be used to construct a pure curve from explicit parameters, to simulate data, or plotting a fitted model.

``` r
monoexponential(t, A = 10, B = 100, tau = 8, TD = 15)
```

* `SSmonoexponential()`, `SSexponential_drift()`, `SSbiexponential()`, `SSlogistic()`, `SSgompertz()`, `SSgompertz_left()`, and `SSsigmoidal_drift()` are the matching self-starting (`selfStart`) wrappers, which generate their own initial parameter estimates and can be fit directly with `stats::nls()`.

``` r
model <- nls(x ~ SSmonoexponential(t, A, B, tau, TD), data = data)
summary(model)
```

## mV̇O~2~ recovery kinetics and muscle Oxidative Capacity assessment

An emerging method using in mNIRS research, a series of repeated brief occlusions can be used to estimate the recovery rate of muscle oxygen uptake from NIRS channels, as a proxy for muscle oxidative capacity. This method can be performed in *{mnirs}* using recursive calls to `analyse_kinetics()`:

* A sequence of data frames containing occlusion intervals (i.e. extracted with `extract_intervals()`) can be passed to `analyse_kinetics(method = "peak_slope")` with appropriate arguments.

* The result can be passed directly to another call of `analyse_kinetics()`, with resulting coefficients supplied explicitly as `time_channel` and `nirs_channels`. `method` will usually be selected as `"monoexponential"` to determine the rate constant (`k`) of mV̇O~2~ recovery (also see *Articles* below).

``` r
## fit an exponential through the peak slopes of successive occlusions
analyse_kinetics(
    occlusion_intervals,
    nirs_channels = hhb,
    method = "peak_slope",
    span = 3,
) |> 
    print() |>  ## print intermediate results and pass along
    analyse_kinetics(
        nirs_channels = slope,
        time_channel = peak_slope_time,
        method = "monoexponential",
        group_intervals = list(trial1 = 1:10, trial2 = 11:20)
    )
```


## Correcting for blood volume changes

* `correct_blood_volume()` is used to normalise NIRS components signals — i.e. *oxy[haem], deoxy[haem], and total[haem]* — for changes in *total[haem]*, which is a proxy for local blood volume/perfusion. This can be done before further analysis, to isolate metabolic O~2~ from mechanical haemodynamics. See `?correct_blood_volume`.

## Articles

* *"Analysing muscle oxidative capacity with mnirs"* walks through a full arterial occlusion OxCap analysis: correcting for blood volume, extracting occlusion intervals, finding peak deoxy[haem] slopes, and fitting a monoexponential through the slope estimates to estimate the mV̇O~2~ recovery rate constant *k*.

* *"Reading and analysing PIONIRS data with mnirs"* demonstrates reading new TD-NIRS `.ftn` & `.ftn2` files, and compares different fit methods to occlusion reoxygenation kinetics.



# mnirs 0.7.2

## `read_mnirs()`

* Reading all files, in particular `.csv`, is faster and allocates less memory.

* Files can now be read from **PIONIRS NIRSBOX**, an advanced time-domain *TD-NIRS* device.

    * PIONIRS explors file types `.ftn` and `.ftn2` for single- and dual-channel TD-NIRS, respectively.
    
    * `read_mnirs()` will automatically detect channels `StO2`, `Time`, and `TagLabel`.
    
    * Example file `pionirs_occlusion.ftn` can be called with `example_mnirs()` (Thanks to Marianna, Dr. Porcelli, and PIONIRS for the demo files).

``` r
example_mnirs("pionirs")
#> [1] "<R library>/mnirs/inst/extdata/pionirs_occlusion.ftn"
```

* **Artinis Oxysoft** file exports are now automatically read more consistently, using the file metadata and *Legend* to rename channels:

    * *"(Sample number)"* (column `1`) is renamed *"sample"* with a derived *"time"* column which is set to `time_channel`.
    
    * *"(Event)"* (the last numbered column with event markers) is renamed *"event"* and is set as `event_channel`. The trailing un-numbered column with event labels is renamed *"labels"*, and can be explicitly renamed: `event_channel = c(labels = "labels")`.

    * All other channels in the *Legend* are renamed and returned as `nirs_channels` by default with clean, lower case names (e.g. *"Rx1 - Tx1 O2Hb"* is renamed as *"rx1_tx1_o2hb"*).
    
    * Channels can be renamed from either their literal *Legend* names; e.g. `nirs_channels = c(o2hb = 2)`, `c(o2hb = "rx1_tx1_o2hb")`, or `c(o2hb = "Rx1 - Tx1 O2Hb")`.

* `create_mnirs_data()` can now rename `nirs_channels`, `time_channel`, and `event_channel` and add the renamed column names to metadata.

``` r
df <- create_mnirs_data(
    PIONIRS_ftn2,
    nirs_channels = c(o2hb = "O2Hb(CH1)", hhb = "HHb(CH1)", thb = "THb(CH1)"),
    time_channel = c(time = "Time"),
    event_channel = c(labels = "TagLabel")
)

attr(df, "nirs_channels")
# [1] "o2hb" "hhb"  "thb" 
```

## Core processing functions

* `extract_intervals()` now accepts a list of multiple `start` and/or `end` values with mixed `by_time()`, `by_label()`, `by_lap()`, or `by_sample()`. Intervals are matched by user-specified order.

``` r
## combine multiple specification types for one boundary
extract_intervals(
    data, 
    start = list(by_lap(2), by_time(400)),
    end = list(by_lap(3), by_label("10-min marker"))
)
```

* `extract_intervals()` Also now properly retains `event_channel` column in ensemble-averaged intervals (`group_intervals = "ensemble"` or custom groups).

* `plot_mnirs()`: small adjustments to plot spacing & point sizes.

* `palette_mnirs()` now returns unnamed colours, which was disrupting use with `ggplot2::scale_colour_manual()`.

``` r
custom_colours <- c(
    smo2_left_vl = palette_mnirs("pink"),
    smo2_right_vl = palette_mnirs("light blue"),
    smo2_left_rf = palette_mnirs("purple"),
    smo2_right_rf = palette_mnirs("dark blue")
)
# smo2_left_vl smo2_right_vl  smo2_left_rf smo2_right_rf 
#  "#ff80ff"   "#0080ff"   "#9f79ee" "#00468Bff" 

plot(result) +
    scale_colour_manual(
        values = c(
            smo2_left_vl = palette_mnirs("pink"),
            smo2_right_vl = palette_mnirs("light blue"),
            smo2_left_rf = palette_mnirs("purple"),
            smo2_right_rf = palette_mnirs("dark blue")
        )
    )

```

* `print.mnirs()` now returns its object invisibly, so can be called incrementally within a function pipeline (which I just learned was possible!).

``` r
read_mnirs(...) |> 
    print() |>  ## intermediate view data frame
    analyse_kinetics(...) |> 
    print() |>  ## view formatted results table
    plot()      ## and plot those results
```

## Package accessories

* *"README"* and *"Reading and Cleaning Data with mnirs"* vignette edited with updated functionality and consistent formatting.

* Included example *"moxy_intervals.csv"* modified *"Lap"* column coincides with intervals start & end, for testing with `extract_intervals()`.


# mnirs 0.7.1

* `shift_mnirs()` now properly excludes partial windows at data edges, where fewer samples can bias calculation of *"min"* or *"max"* shift values on noise.

* `replace_mnirs()`, `shift_mnirs()`, and `filter_moving_average()` should gain a serious performance improvement when calculating rolling means, at the cost of negligible loss of precision on the order of ± ~1e-11.

* Lists of data frames exported from core functions now contain `class = "mnirs"` and should now `plot()` properly.

# mnirs 0.7.0

## Highlights

This minor version update includes mostly internal refactoring, but enough user-facing changes and a few breaking deprecations, so that it's more than just a patch. This version lays the foundation for the incoming (hopefully soon) *mnirs* `analyse_kinetics` suite of functions.

## Working with lists and grouped data frames

* Core processing functions (`resample_mnirs()`, `replace_mnirs()`, `filter_mnirs()`, `shift_mnirs()`, and `rescale_mnirs()`) now accept as the `data` input either a single data frame, a list of data frames, or a grouped data frame (requires `{dplyr}`). Single data frames are processed and returned directly, as previously. Listed and grouped data frames are each processed independently and returned as a named list.

* `extract_intervals()` now also accepts a list of data frames or a grouped data frame and returns one flattened, named list of extracted intervals.

``` r
replace_mnirs(
    data = list(df1, df2),
    outlier_cutoff = 3,
    span = 5
)
#> $interval_1
#> # A tibble:
#>     time  smo2    o2hb
#>    <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>
#>  1   0    42.8 -0.0289
#>  2   0.1  42.8 -0.0524
#>  3   0.2  42.8 -0.0916
#>  4   0.3  42.9 -0.138 
#>  5   0.4  43.2 -0.205 
#> 
#> $interval_2
#> # A tibble:
#>     time  smo2  o2hb
#>    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
#>  1   9.9  51.7 -2.29
#>  2  10    51.7 -2.32
#>  3  10.1  51.8 -2.31
#>  4  10.2  52.2 -2.22
#>  5  10.3  52.4 -2.12
```

## Channel grouping and processing

* **BREAKING CHANGE**: `extract_intervals()`, `shift_mnirs()`, and `rescale_mnirs()` gain argument `group_channels`, which separates channel selection from channel grouping. `nirs_channels` selects channels; the new `group_channels` argument channels specifies *"distinct"*, *"ensemble"*, or custom channel groupp construction.

``` r
shift_mnirs(
    data,
    nirs_channels = c(smo2, o2hb),
    group_channels = "ensemble",
    to = 0,
    span = 5
)
```

* `filter_mnirs()` and `replace_mnirs()` now accept named lists for channel-specific processing arguments, in addition to a single global value as previously. `rescale_mnirs()` and `shift_mnirs()` accept processing arguments specified by channel or group. This way each `nirs_channel` can be processed with unique parameters.

``` r
filter_mnirs(
    data,
    nirs_channels = c(smo2, o2hb),
    method = list(smo2 = "moving_average", o2hb = "butterworth"),
    span = 5,     ## only used by "moving_average" channels
    order = 2,    ## only used by "butterworth" channels (and below args)
    W = 0.02,
    type = "low",
    na.rm = TRUE
)
```

## Function and argument renaming

* `filter_butterworth()` and `filter_moving_average()` are now the renamed canonical functions. `filter_butter()` and `filter_ma()` remain available as aliases.

* **BREAKING CHANGE**: `extract_intervals()` new argument `group_intervals` replaces deprecated `event_groups`. This is where interval grouping is specified for *"distinct"* or *"ensemble"*-averaged, or custom group list construction.

``` r
interval_list <- extract_intervals(
    data,
    nirs_channels = c(smo2_left, smo2_right),
    group_intervals = "ensemble",
    start = by_time(368, 1084),
    span = c(-20, 90)
)
#> $ensemble
#> # A tibble:
#>     time smo2_left smo2_right
#>    <dbl>     <dbl>      <dbl>
#>  1 -20        56.3       59.2
#>  2 -19.9      56.1       59.2
#>  3 -19.8      56.1       59.2
#>  4 -19.7      56.2       58.9
#>  5 -19.6      56.4       58.9
```


## Performance improvements & bug fixes

### `read_mnirs()`

* Improved reading of delimited files containing extra spaces around quoted values.
* Documented support for `.txt` files.
* Made automatic device and channel detection more efficient and improved related messages.
* `nirs_channel` now identified before type conversion, ensuring coercion to numeric.
* Added a warning when all values in `nirs_channels` become missing during numeric coercion.
* Improved handling of timestamp values; absolute date-times, time-only values, header timestamps, and POSIXct-type `time_channel` column.
* Refined `sample_rate` detection and warnings for irregular samples.

### `create_mnirs_data()`

* Grouped data now remain grouped when *mnirs* metadata is added or refreshed.

### `resample_mnirs()`

* `data` arg now accepts a list or grouped data frame and returns one processed data frame per data frame.
* Clarified documentation that downsampling numeric columns uses averages based on linear interpolation, rather than time-weighted averages.

### `replace_mnirs()`

* `data` arg now accepts a list or grouped data frame and returns one processed data frame per data frame.
* Arguments can be specified per-`nirs_channels` as named lists.
* Improved performance via local-median calculations when values are missing.
* Made fixed-width outlier detection faster by calculating rolling medians across many windows together.
* Added clearer checks for invalid window settings and unsorted or missing time values.

### `filter_mnirs()`

* `data` arg now accepts a list or grouped data frame and returns one processed data frame per data frame.
* Arguments can be specified per-`nirs_channels` as named lists.
* Filter settings such as `spar`, `W`, `fc`, `width`, and `span` are now explicit function arguments, making available options easier to discover.
* Simplified filter selection so each channel is sent directly to its chosen filter method.
* `filter_butterworth()` and `filter_moving_average()` are now the main worker functions; `filter_butter()` and `filter_ma()` remain available as aliases.
* Improved checks and messages for missing values, cutoff frequencies, window sizes, and unsupported settings.

### `shift_mnirs()`

* `data` arg now accepts a list or grouped data frame and returns one processed data frame per data frame.
* Arguments can be specified per-`nirs_channels` as named lists, or per-named group via `group_channels` (see below).
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Channel grouping through a list to process channels together is now supplied to `group_channels`. Supplying a list to `nirs_channels` is deprecated.
* `nirs_channels` now defaults to `NULL`, allowing channels to be taken from *mnirs* metadata as elsewhere in the package.

### `rescale_mnirs()`

* `data` arg now accepts a list or grouped data frame and returns one processed data frame per data frame.
* Arguments can be specified per-`nirs_channels` as named lists, or per-named group via `group_channels` (see below).
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Channel grouping through a list to process channels together is now supplied to `group_channels`. Supplying a list to `nirs_channels` is deprecated.
* `nirs_channels` now defaults to `NULL`, allowing channels to be taken from *mnirs* metadata as elsewhere in the package.

### `extract_intervals()`

* `data` arg now accepts a list or grouped data frame and returns *one named list* with interval names that identify their source data frame and interval sequence number.
* Arguments can be specified per-`nirs_channels` as named lists.
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Interval grouping for ensemble-averaging is now supplied to `group_intervals`, renamed from `event_groups`. `event_groups` is now deprecated.
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Channel grouping through a list to process channels together is now supplied to `group_channels`. Supplying a list to `nirs_channels` is deprecated.
* Added checks for interval groups and their selected channels, with clearer errors for invalid group numbers, unknown channels, and invalid time boundaries.
* Updated ensemble averaging so each interval group can use its own per-channel argument selection.
* Improved naming, zero-time handling, and preservation of *mnirs* metadata in extracted intervals.

### `plot.mnirs()`

* `data` arg accepts a list or grouped data frame and returns facetted plots per data frame (existing functionality since *mnirs 0.6.3*, documenting for clarity).
* Time (x-) axis now displays units `mm:ss` for data lasting less than one hour and `h:mm:ss` for longer data.
* Facets now follow the order of intervals in the input instead of being reordered alphabetically.
* Improved error messages for empty or invalid lists of data frames.

### Internal validation & shared functions

* Improved errors and warnings package-wide so they point to the function called by the user rather than an internal checking function.
* Added `as_data_list.R` containing shared support for processing `data` argument from one data frame, a list of data frames, or a grouped data frame. Existing *mnirs* metadata is kept for each interval.
* Added `channel_args.R` containing shared support for setting processing options separately for each `nirs_channel` or per-group (for `shift_mnirs()`, `replace_mnirs()`, and `extract_intervals()`) as a list named by `nirs_channels`. One (vector) value can still be supplied to all channels by default.
* Added clear warnings for unknown channel names and errors for conflicting values within a group.




# mnirs 0.6.5

## `read_mnirs()`

* `read_mnirs()` can now handle `c(".txt", ".tsv")` files via the same `data.table::fread()` pathway as `".csv"`. There are occasionally still odd file formats where columns will not be properly detetcted, usually where files are designed to be human-readible not machine-readable.

* `read_mnirs(nirs_channels = NULL)` now automatically returns **all** channels starting with "SmO2" (case insensitive), which is the most common NIRS channel name for wearable mNIRS devices. Previously, only the first detected nirs channel was returned.

``` r
## read an mNIRS file with two "smo2" channels
df <- read_mnirs(file_path = example_mnirs("moxy_ramp"))

attr(df, "nirs_channels")
#> [1] "SmO2 Live"    "SmO2 Live(2)"
```

## Core function updates

* `extract_intervals()` helper function `by_label()` matches character strings as regular expressions (regex) by default. Now more clearly documents this, and accepts two additional arguments for better handling character strings, which are both `FALSE` be default and must be explicitly opted into (see `?grep`):

    * `by_label(ignore_case = TRUE)` ignore case when evaluating strings.

    * `by_label(fixed = TRUE)` treat labels as fixed strings rather than regular expressions. Useful when labels contain regex metacharacters (`.`, `*`, `(`, etc.).

* `plot.mnirs()` internal update to pass additional arguments `n.breaks` to y-axis breaks, and `breaks` to x-axis breaks.

* `format_hmmss()` can now display fractional seconds values.

* `replace_mnirs()`, `resample_mnirs()`, and some other functions return more informative error message when `time_channel` has irregularly sampled values (time series must be monotonically increasing, non `NA`).


# mnirs 0.6.4

## Bug fix

* Fix a memory allocation bug with `resample_mnirs`. Downsampling 100k rows now allocates ~11MB rather than ~4.5 GB.

# mnirs 0.6.3

## Plotting improvements

* Generic `plot.mnirs()` ncan now be called on a list of *"mnirs"* data frames. Each data frame will be printed as a facet. This is primarily useful for printing a list of interval data frames exported from `extract_intervals()`:

``` r
read_mnirs() |> 
    extract_intervals() |> 
    plot()
## returns a plot with a facet for each interval
```

* To faciliate this, `extract_intervals()` now returns a list of data frames with `class = "mnirs"`. Otherwise, to manually plot a list of data frames, it will need to have `class(list) <- c("mnirs", class(list))` edited manually.

``` r
read_mnirs() |> 
    extract_intervals() |> 
    class()
#> [1] "mnirs" "list"
```

* Backend improvement: `print.mnirs()` generic created to avoid displaying extra `NextMethod()` calls when printing lists with `class = "mnirs"`.

## Modified lap extraction behaviour

* `extract_intervals()`: 

    * When specifying `start` and `end` with `by_lap()`, `start` will only refer to the first sample of the lap, and `end` the last sample.

    * With previous behaviour, `start = by_lap()` would include the entire specified lap(s). But this resulted in less control over displaying only parts of a lap.
    
    * Updated behaviour is now more consistent with `by_time`, `by_label`, and `by_sample()` methods, which reference `start` and `end` from a single sample. This allows extraction of e.g. only the first 60-sec of lap:

```r
read_mnirs() |> 
    extract_intervals(
        start = by_lap(1, 3),
        span = c(0, 60),
    )
## returns a list of two intervals with the first 60-sec of laps 1 and 3, respectively.
```

## Updated core functions

* `read_mnirs()`: Fix detection issue with *"PerfPro"* file formats, and another small bug fix to improve timestamp parsing.

* `create_mnirs_data()` now properly accepts tidy evaluation for `nirs_channels`, `time_channel`, and `event_channel`:

```r
create_mnirs_data(df, nirs_channels = c(o2hb, hhb))
```

* `resample_mnirs()`: 

    * Now resamples to an inclusive time range around existing data, rounded to the nearest resampled rate. Better handles edge cases where the last sample was being dropped in certain rounding conditions.

    * Fix an edge case error when `sample_rate` was mis-specified higher than the actual sample_rate of the data. Now more robustly fills non-numeric columns.


# mnirs 0.6.2

## Core updates

* `read_mnirs()`: 
    
    * Now properly parses `time_channel` as fractional unix values; i.e. timestamp (e.g. "hh:mm:ss") values are saved by Excel in all its infinite wisdom as numeric fractional Unix timestamps. Will now be properly coerced to numeric and POSIXct timestamp values can be returned.

    * Timestamps should now be returned in the user's local time zone.

## Core function argument changes

* `resample_mnirs()`: Update default `method = "none"`. Less opinionated default to force users to explicitly opt-in to specifying either "linear" or "locf" methods to fill/interpolate across new samples. Updated package documentation.

* `replace_invalid()`, `replace_outliers()`, `replace_missing()`: Remove `bypass_checks` arg intended for internal use only, to bypass redundant checks when calling from `replace_mnirs()`.

## Small edits

* `plot.mnirs()`: No longer coerces to long format data behind the scenes.

* `plot.mnirs()`: y-axis title changed from "signal" to "mNIRS".

* Create `AGENTS.md` for LLM-friendly instructions. Added to `.Rbuildignore` until better packaging solution found.

* Fix lap marker inconsistency in `train.red_intervals.csv`. Updated relevant interval times in documentation.

* `README.md` & *"reading-mnirs-data.qmd"* vignette updates.

    * Update recommended core processing sequence: `read_mnirs()` -> `resample_mnirs()` -> `replace_mnirs()` -> ...

    * Update `extract_intervals()` vignette to `train.red_intervals.csv` end-interval reoxygenation events.

* Small documentation changes.


# mnirs 0.6.1

## Bug fixes

* Core functions updated to accept `nirs_channel` args as a list. 
    
    * An info message will be displayed when a list is not required, instead of erroring.

    * Additional info messages will be displayed for `shift_mnirs()`, `rescale_mnirs()`, and `extract_intervals()` when `nirs_channels` has not been specified as a list, nor retrieved from metadata. As a reminder of the grouping requirements in those functions.

* Core functions now properly update `nirs_channels` metadata when re-specified.
    
    * Previously, specifying `nirs_channels` in a function would only add any additional column name strings to the existing metadata rather than overwrite it. Meaning `nirs_channels` could only be removed from metadata by using `create_mnirs_data(nirs_channels = "...")`. The updated behaviour should mean channels need to be re-specified less often.

* `filter_mnirs()`: Fixed an error matching `method` arguments when left blank.

* *README* and *"Reading and Cleaning Data with {mnirs}"* vignette updated to fix typos and small edits.

# mnirs 0.6.0

## Prepare for CRAN submission

* *NEWS.md* is truncated to the most recent relevant release updates. The full *NEWS.md* remains in the `dev` branch.

* Some development functions have been omitted from the package build in expectation of CRAN review. They are still present in `dev` branch and can be installed with `pak::pak("jemarnold/mnirs")`.

### Updated core functions

* `filter_mnirs()`: Method-specific arguments (e.g. `order` for `method = "butterworth"`, or `width` for `method = "moving_average"`) removed from the generic function call. Continue to be passed to the appropriate method via `...`. Documentation and info/warning/abort messages updated.

* `filter_ma()` better separates effects of `partial` and `na.rm` args:
    
    * `partial = FALSE` by default returns NA at edges where insufficient number of samples are available compared to the specified `width` or `span`.
    
    * `partial = TRUE` calculates mean values at edges, as long as one valid non-`NA` sample is available.
    
    * `na.rm = FALSE` by default behaves as expected with `mean(na.rm = FALSE)`, propagating any `NA`s in the local window to the calculated mean with a warning.
        
        * **NOTE** This differs from the behaviour of `na.rm = FALSE` in `filter_butter()`, which errors if there are any internal `NA`s present. This has not been changed.
    
    * `na.rm = TRUE` ignores `NA`s and calculates local means as long as one valid sample is present.

* `plot.mnirs()`
    
    * Add new arg: `points = TRUE` will plot points in addition to lines, as a useful quick shortcut.
    
    * Update `na.omit` now omits non-valid `c(NA, NaN, Inf, -Inf)` values from plotting, not just `NA`.

* `palette_mnirs()` can now accept either a single numeric value specifying the number of colours to return, or any number of (valid) character colour names.


# mnirs 0.5.2

### Shiny app

* Update online shiny app hosted at <https://jemarnold-mnirs-app.share.connect.posit.cloud/> with basic reading and pre-processing functionality.

# mnirs 0.5.1

### Updated core functions

* `read_mnirs()` now has better automated channel detection logic for *"Artinis" / "Oxysoft"* file formats. `nirs_channels` and `time_channel` can be left blank to automatically *"sample"*, *"time"* (from `sample_rate`), and nirs channel *"2"*.

* `replace_outliers()` now accepts numeric `outlier_cutoff` values for more precise outlier detection thresholds (previously was integers only). Documentation also updated.

* `filter_mnirs.moving_average()` now accepts `partial` argument passed to `filter_ma()`, which permits calculation with fewer than the specified number of valid samples in the local window, allowing calculation when missing values (`NA`) are present.

### Updated internal functions

* `signif_trailing()` simplified with `format = c("digits", "signif")` printing the lesser of either `digits` or the max decimal/sigfigs in the data, by default when new arg: `trim = TRUE`. Otherwise `trim = FALSE` will print to the exact number of `digits`.


# mnirs 0.5.0

### Updated core functions

* `read_mnirs()` expands `event_channel` to work with integer *"lap"* numbers, or character event label as previous.
    
    * Should now work on more .csv file formats; previously read errors may have occured where the file contained header rows above the data table, resulting in improper detection of columns.
    
    * `event_channel` can now be specified as an integer `lap` column, in addition to a character column as previous.
    
    * Other {mnirs} functions may expect `event_channel` to be either character or integer-ish.

* `extract_intervals()` ***breaking change*** to argument specification:
    
    * Function arguments `start` and `end` replace `event_times`, `event_labels`, and `event_samples`. Allowing for more flexible and more clear interval boundary specifications.
    
    * Helper functions `by_time()`, `by_label()`, `by_lap()`, and `by_sample()` added to specify `start`/`end` values.
    
    * Fix edge-cases where metadata were not returned as expected.    

* `resample_mnirs()` now defaults to `method = "locf"` which is safer for more column types where interpolation may not be appropriate (integer, discrete numeric, character, factors, etc).

* `filter_ma()` has been renamed from `filter_moving_average()`. The latter is kept as an alias of the former.

* `peak_slope()` now returns a *"fitted"* vector with the linear regression predicted values within the peak slope window. 

### Updated articles

* README:
    
    * Add basic use covering `extract_intervals()`.
    
    * Add rough draft *{mnirs}* hex icon.

* *"Reading and Cleaning Data with {mnirs}"* vignette:
    
    * Add section: *"Detect and extract intervals"* covering `extract_intervals()` core functionality.

* Rough draft at creating an {mnirs} cheatsheet.

### Documentation

* Many function help documents re-written to be more readible.

* Updated function examples with clearer conditions for CRAN submission.

### Example files
    
* Update `train.red_intervals.csv` revert to include original onboard smoothed and unfiltered NIRS channels.

* Remove `vo2master.csv` from example data, as it is only used for internal testing.


# mnirs 0.4.2

* Update `read_mnirs()` 
    * Fix internal `read_file()` to better recognise .csv formats where the header has fewer columns than the data table.
    * If `nirs_channels` is left blank (now default), `read_mnirs()` will attempt to recognise the NIRS device file format by searching for known data table column headers, and return the entire data table as if `keep_all = TRUE`, as a data exploration option.
    * Update `add_timestamp` to recognise date-time (POSIXct) values in the file header or `time_channel` and add `timestamp` column, and metadata `attr(df, "start_timestamp")`.
* Update `plot.mnirs()`
    * Rename argument to `time_labels` from `label_time` for more consistent naming convention.
    * Better label arguments `time_labels`, `n.breaks`, `na.omit`.
    * Remove `tidyr` dependency.
* Rename `extract_intervals()` argument to `event_groups` from `group_events` for more consistent naming convention.
* Fix bug with `replace_mnirs(method = "linear")` unnecessarily calling for `width` or `span` to be specified.
* Update `signif_trailing()` to avoid overprinting digits. Used internally for display.
    * `format = c("max_digits", "max_signif")` will print the lesser of either `digits`, or the maximum decimals/sigfigs in the data.
* Update function documentation.
* Update `README.Rmd` for updated function args.
* Update `reading-mnirs-data.qmd` vignette for updated function calls and some editing.
* Update `oxcap-analysis.qmd` with small edits.
* Remove `{tidyr}` dependency from `plot.mnirs()`, and from `{mnirs}` package dependencies.

* Minors updates to `monoexponential` family of functions.
    * Fix `SSmonoexp3()` to not internally look for `TD` parameter. 
    * Remove `monoexp_init()` from exported to internal.

# mnirs 0.4.0

* Create `monoexponential()`, `SSmonoexp3()`, and `SSmonoexp4()` self-starting model functions.
    * `monoexponential()` is the equation for a 4-parameter monoexponential function with parametera "A", "B", "tau", and "TD".
    * `SSmonoexp*()` are self-starting functions for `nls()` or other curve fitting functions, for either the 4-parameter monoexponential function, or a reduced 3-parameter function without a time delay ("TD").
    * `fix_coef()` is used to update a model with any number of parameters set to fixed values, e.g. if the starting or ending values are known a priori. By entering fixed values, the remaining parameters are left free to be optimised (experimental function, may not work when called from within nested function conditions, need to further validate).  
* Add `vo2master.csv` example file recorded with VO2 Master Manager app (thanks Philip Skotzke).
* Update `read_mnirs()` to correctly convert "," decimal values to numeric (thanks Philip Skotzke).

* Remove `na.rm` arg from `slope()`, `rolling_slope()`, `peak_slope()` in favour of opinionated `na.rm = TRUE` behaviour.
    * `partial = FALSE` effectively covers `na.rm = FALSE` where fewer than `width` number valid samples exist in local vector.
    * `na.rm` arg currently remains in `filter_mnirs()` functions, but this may be removed in the future.
* Fix `read_mnirs()` internally `read_file()` to better handle .csv files.
    * Implement `data.table::fread()` to handle .csv with empty rows and long string metadata in the header above the data table.
    * Awaiting future expanded `{data.table}` implementation across `{mnirs}`, i.e. for `data.table::froll*` functions.
* Fix `filter_moving_average()` to correctly identify windows where `partial = FALSE` was not met due to `NA`s.

* Integrate [roll][roll::roll-package] for faster rolling median, mean, and lm implementation under certain conditions.
    * Currently used: `roll_lm()` for `rolling_slope()`, `roll_median()` for `replace_outliers()`, `roll_mean()` for `filter_moving_average()`.
    * May roll back in favour of `data.table::froll_*` when 1.17.99+ is updated on CRAN.
* Update local rolling functions with `align = c("center", "left", "right")` arg.
    * Currently used: internal `compute_local_windows()` for `rolling_slope()`.
* Update internal `compute_local_fun()` to allow additional arguments, e.g. for `na.rm = TRUE`.
* Remove redundant internal numeric rounding. Results may now have floating point precision issues, but avoid compounding rounding error.
    * Affects: `filter_mnirs.smooth_spline()`, `filter_mnirs.moving_average()`, `parse_sample_rate()` and `clean_invalid()` for `read_mnirs()`, `replace_mnirs()`, `resample_mnirs()`, `shift_mnirs()`, `validate_sample_rate()`.
* Add hidden `bypass_check` argument to reduce overhead from validation redundancy.
    * Affects: `replace_invalid()`, `replace_outliers()`, `replace_missing()`, `filter_moving_average()`, new functions `slope()`, `rolling_slope()`.
* Update `validate_numeric()` logic to reduce overhead.
