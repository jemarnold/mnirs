# Changelog

## mnirs 0.6.3

### Plotting improvements

- Generic
  [`plot.mnirs()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/plot.mnirs.md)
  ncan now be called on a list of *“mnirs”* data frames. Each data frame
  will be printed as a facet. This is primarily useful for printing a
  list of interval data frames exported from
  [`extract_intervals()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/extract_intervals.md):

``` r

read_mnirs() |> 
    extract_intervals() |> 
    plot()
## returns a plot with a facet for each interval
```

- To faciliate this,
  [`extract_intervals()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/extract_intervals.md)
  now returns a list of data frames with `class = "mnirs"`. Otherwise,
  to manually plot a list of data frames, it will need to have
  `class(list) <- c("mnirs", class(list))` edited manually.

``` r

read_mnirs() |> 
    extract_intervals() |> 
    class()
#> [1] "mnirs" "list"
```

- Backend improvement:
  [`print.mnirs()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/print.mnirs.md)
  generic created to avoid displaying extra
  [`NextMethod()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/UseMethod.html) calls when
  printing lists with `class = "mnirs"`.

### Modified lap extraction behaviour

- [`extract_intervals()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/extract_intervals.md):

  - When specifying `start` and `end` with
    [`by_lap()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/by_time.md),
    `start` will only refer to the first sample of the lap, and `end`
    the last sample.

  - With previous behaviour, `start = by_lap()` would include the entire
    specified lap(s). But this resulted in less control over displaying
    only parts of a lap.

  - Updated behaviour is now more consistent with `by_time`, `by_label`,
    and
    [`by_sample()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/by_time.md)
    methods, which reference `start` and `end` from a single sample.
    This allows extraction of e.g. only the first 60-sec of lap:

``` r

read_mnirs() |> 
    extract_intervals(
        start = by_lap(1, 3),
        span = c(0, 60),
    )
## returns a list of two intervals with the first 60-sec of laps 1 and 3, respectively.
```

### Updated core functions

- [`read_mnirs()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/read_mnirs.md):
  Fix detection issue with *“PerfPro”* file formats, and another small
  bug fix to improve timestamp parsing.

- [`create_mnirs_data()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/create_mnirs_data.md)
  now properly accepts tidy evaluation for `nirs_channels`,
  `time_channel`, and `event_channel`:

``` r

create_mnirs_data(df, nirs_channels = c(o2hb, hhb))
```

- [`resample_mnirs()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/resample_mnirs.md):

  - Now resamples to an inclusive time range around existing data,
    rounded to the nearest resampled rate. Better handles edge cases
    where the last sample was being dropped in certain rounding
    conditions.

  - Fix an edge case error when `sample_rate` was mis-specified higher
    than the actual sample_rate of the data. Now more robustly fills
    non-numeric columns.

## mnirs 0.6.2

CRAN release: 2026-04-18

### Core updates

- [`read_mnirs()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/read_mnirs.md):

  - Now properly parses `time_channel` as fractional unix values;
    i.e. timestamp (e.g. “hh:mm:ss”) values are saved by Excel in all
    its infinite wisdom as numeric fractional Unix timestamps. Will now
    be properly coerced to numeric and POSIXct timestamp values can be
    returned.

  - Timestamps should now be returned in the user’s local time zone.

### Core function argument changes

- [`resample_mnirs()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/resample_mnirs.md):
  Update default `method = "none"`. Less opinionated default to force
  users to explicitly opt-in to specifying either “linear” or “locf”
  methods to fill/interpolate across new samples. Updated package
  documentation.

- [`replace_invalid()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/replace_mnirs.md),
  [`replace_outliers()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/replace_mnirs.md),
  [`replace_missing()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/replace_mnirs.md):
  Remove `bypass_checks` arg intended for internal use only, to bypass
  redundant checks when calling from
  [`replace_mnirs()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/replace_mnirs.md).

### Small edits

- [`plot.mnirs()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/plot.mnirs.md):
  No longer coerces to long format data behind the scenes.

- [`plot.mnirs()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/plot.mnirs.md):
  y-axis title changed from “signal” to “mNIRS”.

- Fix lap marker inconsistency in `train.red_intervals.csv`. Updated
  relevant interval times in documentation.

- `README.md` & *“reading-mnirs-data.qmd”* vignette updates.

  - Update recommended core processing sequence:
    [`read_mnirs()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/read_mnirs.md)
    -\>
    [`resample_mnirs()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/resample_mnirs.md)
    -\>
    [`replace_mnirs()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/replace_mnirs.md)
    -\> …

  - Update
    [`extract_intervals()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/extract_intervals.md)
    vignette to `train.red_intervals.csv` end-interval reoxygenation
    events.

- Small documentation changes.

## mnirs 0.6.1

### Bug fixes

- Core functions updated to accept `nirs_channel` args as a list.

  - An info message will be displayed when a list is not required,
    instead of erroring.

  - Additional info messages will be displayed for
    [`shift_mnirs()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/shift_mnirs.md),
    [`rescale_mnirs()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/rescale_mnirs.md),
    and
    [`extract_intervals()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/extract_intervals.md)
    when `nirs_channels` has not been specified as a list, nor retrieved
    from metadata. As a reminder of the grouping requirements in those
    functions.

- Core functions now properly update `nirs_channels` metadata when
  re-specified.

  - Previously, specifying `nirs_channels` in a function would only add
    any additional column name strings to the existing metadata rather
    than overwrite it. Meaning `nirs_channels` could only be removed
    from metadata by using `create_mnirs_data(nirs_channels = "...")`.
    The updated behaviour should mean channels need to be re-specified
    less often.

- [`filter_mnirs()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/filter_mnirs.md):
  Fixed an error matching `method` arguments when left blank.

- *README* and *“Reading and Cleaning Data with {mnirs}”* vignette
  updated to fix typos and small edits.

## mnirs 0.6.0

CRAN release: 2026-03-30

### Prepare for CRAN submission

- *NEWS.md* is truncated to the most recent relevant release updates.
  The full *NEWS.md* remains in the `dev` branch.

- Some development functions have been omitted from the package build in
  expectation of CRAN review. They are still present in `dev` branch and
  can be installed with `pak::pak("jemarnold/mnirs")`.

#### Updated core functions

- [`filter_mnirs()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/filter_mnirs.md):
  Method-specific arguments (e.g. `order` for `method = "butterworth"`,
  or `width` for `method = "moving_average"`) removed from the generic
  function call. Continue to be passed to the appropriate method via
  `...`. Documentation and info/warning/abort messages updated.

- [`filter_ma()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/filter_ma.md)
  better separates effects of `partial` and `na.rm` args:

  - `partial = FALSE` by default returns NA at edges where insufficient
    number of samples are available compared to the specified `width` or
    `span`.

  - `partial = TRUE` calculates mean values at edges, as long as one
    valid non-`NA` sample is available.

  - `na.rm = FALSE` by default behaves as expected with
    `mean(na.rm = FALSE)`, propagating any `NA`s in the local window to
    the calculated mean with a warning.

    - **NOTE** This differs from the behaviour of `na.rm = FALSE` in
      [`filter_butter()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/filter_butter.md),
      which errors if there are any internal `NA`s present. This has not
      been changed.

  - `na.rm = TRUE` ignores `NA`s and calculates local means as long as
    one valid sample is present.

- [`plot.mnirs()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/plot.mnirs.md)

  - Add new arg: `points = TRUE` will plot points in addition to lines,
    as a useful quick shortcut.

  - Update `na.omit` now omits non-valid `c(NA, NaN, Inf, -Inf)` values
    from plotting, not just `NA`.

- [`palette_mnirs()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/palette_mnirs.md)
  can now accept either a single numeric value specifying the number of
  colours to return, or any number of (valid) character colour names.

## mnirs 0.5.2

#### Shiny app

- Update online shiny app hosted at
  <https://jemarnold-mnirs-app.share.connect.posit.cloud/> with basic
  reading and pre-processing functionality.

## mnirs 0.5.1

#### Updated core functions

- [`read_mnirs()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/read_mnirs.md)
  now has better automated channel detection logic for *“Artinis” /
  “Oxysoft”* file formats. `nirs_channels` and `time_channel` can be
  left blank to automatically *“sample”*, *“time”* (from `sample_rate`),
  and nirs channel *“2”*.

- [`replace_outliers()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/replace_mnirs.md)
  now accepts numeric `outlier_cutoff` values for more precise outlier
  detection thresholds (previously was integers only). Documentation
  also updated.

## mnirs 0.5.0

#### Updated core functions

- [`read_mnirs()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/read_mnirs.md)
  expands `event_channel` to work with integer *“lap”* numbers, or
  character event label as previous.

  - Should now work on more .csv file formats; previously read errors
    may have occured where the file contained header rows above the data
    table, resulting in improper detection of columns.

  - `event_channel` can now be specified as an integer `lap` column, in
    addition to a character column as previous.

  - Other {mnirs} functions may expect `event_channel` to be either
    character or integer-ish.

- [`extract_intervals()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/extract_intervals.md):

  - Function arguments `start` and `end` are used to specify one or both
    of a start and end point to the target interval.

  - Specify `start`/`end` values with helper functions
    [`by_time()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/by_time.md),
    [`by_label()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/by_time.md),
    [`by_lap()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/by_time.md),
    and
    [`by_sample()`](https://jemarnold.github.io/mnirs/reference/by_time.md).

  - Numeric values are automatically coerced to “time” values; Explicit
    integer values (e.g. `2L`) are coerced to “lap”; Character strings
    are coerced to event “label”.

#### Package resources

- A rough draft *{mnirs}* hex icon and package cheatsheet have been
  added.
