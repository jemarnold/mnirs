\title{Update a model object with Fixed coefficients}
\usage{
fix_coefs(model, data = NULL, verbose = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An existing model object from \code{lm}, \code{nls}, \code{glm}, and others.}

\item{data}{An \emph{optional} data frame to supply manually if original data
frame is unavailable from a different parent environment.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Default is \code{TRUE}. Will display or silence (if
\code{FALSE}) warnings and information messages helpful for troubleshooting. A
global default can be set via \code{options(mnirs.verbose = FALSE)}.}

\item{...}{Named model coefficients to fix.}
}
\value{
An updated model object with remaining free coefficients.
}
\description{
Re-fit a model with fixed coefficients provided as additional arguments. Fixed
coefficients are not modified when optimising for best fit.
}
\details{
If no fixed coefficients are supplied, or if a coefficient does not exist
in the model, the model will be returned unchanged (with a warning).

The function cannot update if all model coefficients are supplied as fixed,
and will abort.
