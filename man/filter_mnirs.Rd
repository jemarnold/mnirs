\description{
Apply digital filtering/smoothing to numeric vector data within a data frame
using either:
\enumerate{
\item A cubic smoothing spline.
\item A Butterworth digital filter.
\item A simple moving average.

\details{
\describe{
\item{\verb{method = }\emph{\code{"smooth_spline"}}}{Applies a non-parametric cubic
smoothing spline from \code{\link[stats:smooth.spline]{stats::smooth.spline()}}. Smoothing is defined
by the parameter \code{spar}, which can be left as \code{NULL} and automatically
determined via penalised log liklihood. This usually works well for
smoothing responses occurring on the order of minutes or longer. \code{spar}
can be defined explicitly, typically (but not necessarily) in the range
\verb{spar = [0, 1]}.}

\item{\verb{method = }\emph{\code{"butterworth"}}}{Applies a centred (two-pass
symmetrical) Butterworth digital filter from \code{\link[signal:butter]{signal::butter()}} and
\code{\link[signal:filtfilt]{signal::filtfilt()}}.

Filter \code{type} defines how the desired signal frequencies are either
passed or rejected from the output signal. \emph{Low-pass} and \emph{high-pass}
filters allow only frequencies \emph{lower} or \emph{higher} than the cutoff
frequency \code{W} to be passed through as the output signal, respectively.
\emph{Stop-band} defines a critical range of frequencies which are rejected
from the output signal. \emph{Pass-band} defines a critical range of
frequencies which are passed through as the output signal.

The filter order (number of passes) is defined by \code{n}, typically in
the range \verb{n = [1, 10]}. Higher filter order tends to capture more
rapid changes in amplitude, but also causes more distortion around
those change points in the signal. General advice is to use the
lowest filter order which sufficiently captures the desired rapid
responses in the data.

The critical (cutoff) frequency is defined by \code{W}, a numeric value for
\emph{low-pass} and \emph{high-pass} filters, or a two-element vector
\code{c(low, high)} defining the lower and upper bands for \emph{stop-band} and
\emph{pass-band} filters. \code{W} represents the desired fractional cutoff
frequency in the range \verb{W = [0, 1]}, where \code{1} is the Nyquist
frequency, i.e., half the sample rate of the data in Hz.

Alternatively, the cutoff frequency can be defined by \code{fc} and
\code{sample_rate} together. \code{fc} represents the desired cutoff frequency
in Hz, and \code{sample_rate} is the sample rate of the recorded data in
Hz. \code{W = fc / (sample_rate / 2)}.

Only One of either \code{W} or \code{fc} should be defined. If both are defined,
\code{W} will be preferred over \code{fc}.}

\item{\verb{method = }\emph{\code{"moving_average"}}}{Applies a centred (symmetrical)
moving average filter in a local window, defined by either \code{width}
as the number of samples around \code{idx} between \verb{[idx - floor(width/2),}
\verb{idx + floor(width/2)]}. Or by \code{span} as the timespan in units of
\code{time_channel} between \verb{[t - span/2, t + span/2]}. A partial moving
average will be calculated at the edges of the data.}
}

Missing values (\code{NA}) in \code{nirs_channels} will cause an error for \verb{method =}
\emph{\code{"smooth_spline"}} or \emph{\code{"butterworth"}}, unless \code{na.rm = TRUE}. Then
\code{NA}s will be preserved and passed through in the returned data.
